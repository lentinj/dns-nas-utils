This is a small set of tools for making your D-Link NAS do it's thing.
Supports at least the DNS-320 and DNS-325

Installing
==========

Until I get around to adding it to an apt repository, it can be installed
thus::

  wget https://github.com/lentinj/dns-nas-utils/raw/master/dns-nas-utils.deb
  dpkg -i dns-nas-utils.deb

Configuration
=============

Some devices or users must need different configuraiton parameters in the daemon.
Available parameters are in a config file in etc/dns-nas-utils.conf. Check it for
more information.

Temperature
===========

Reads temperature (either via. I2C or ttyS1) and returns in degC. For example::

  # dns_temp
  38

NAS utils daemon
================

A small shell-based daemon to control the fan based on NAS temperature. In
theory it can measure temperature of HDDs too, however hddtemp counts as
activity as far as the HDDs are concerned, so won't spin down. It informs kernel
log on changes to easily track them if required.

It controls too hdd leds, to make it to blink on disk activity and send harddrive
power state information  (idle/sleep/active) to the kernel.

Building package
================

Can be done with this command::

  gzip -9c changelog > dns-nas-utils/usr/share/doc/dns-nas-utils/changelog.gz
  fakeroot dpkg-deb --build dns-nas-utils
